## Introduction

Welcome to ProLeagueVizz, an interactive Shiny app designed to provide insights into professional League of Legends data. The app is dedicated to analyzing player statistics and aims to expand its features to cover team statistics and team comparisons in the future.

### Inspiration

The world of professional League of Legends is a rapidly evolving and growing field. While it may not yet have reached the global scale of traditional competitive sports like football or basketball, it's undeniably gaining momentum and attracting an ever-increasing fan base. With this growth comes a wealth of data that is being generated by every match, every player, and every team. This data is a goldmine of information that has the potential to illuminate the intricacies of the game, the strategies employed by teams, and the exceptional skills of players.

### The Importance of Data Analysis

However, despite the availability of this data online, it often presents a challenge to interpret and harness effectively. In the midst of this data explosion, we find ourselves faced with a critical need: the ability to compare players and teams, assess a player's performance based on specific statistics, and gain deeper insights into the game itself. Moreover, in this relatively new and evolving field, many of the metrics we encounter are ripe for exploration and innovation, offering the potential for groundbreaking discoveries.

### Bridging the Gap with ProLeagueVizz

The goal of ProLeagueVizz is to bridge this gap between raw data and meaningful insights. We've created this app to present the existing data in a visual, intuitive manner that simplifies comparisons, facilitates player and team analysis, and helps users gain a deeper understanding of the game. As we move forward, our vision extends beyond visualization; we're excited to explore and introduce advanced metrics that can unlock new dimensions of analysis and offer fresh perspectives on players, teams, and the game of League of Legends itself.

In a rapidly evolving field where the potential for insights is vast and uncharted, ProLeagueVizz strives to be a valuable resource for both casual fans and serious analysts. We invite you to join us on this journey of discovery as we uncover the hidden stories within the data and contribute to the evolving narrative of professional League of Legends.

## Features

### Player Statistics

In the **Player Statistics** section of ProLeagueVizz, you'll find a comprehensive collection of the most important statistics regarding a player's performance. The section allows you to navigate seamlessly between different tournaments from various years in which the player participated. Notably, you can gain insights into how the player's performance compares to others within the same event or tournament.

#### Basic Player Details

The section begins by presenting key player information, including their name, team, trajectory, and tournament results. This provides a solid foundation for understanding the player's context within the League of Legends competitive landscape.

#### Early Game Performance

Delve into the player's early game performance metrics. This includes crucial details such as their first blood statistics (both given and received), CS (Creep Score) difference, and more. The early game insights can be viewed in comparison to all players of the tournament or exclusively within the player's specific role or position.

#### Aggression Analysis

The **Aggression** subsection offers a deeper understanding of the player's aggression level. This aspect is pivotal in comprehending how much the player contributes to their team's damage, kills, assists, and overall impact. Furthermore, the analysis provides the player's KDA (Kill/Death/Assist ratio) and solo kills, offering valuable insights into their gameplay style. As with previous sections, these metrics can be examined in the context of all tournament players or exclusively within the player's role.

#### Efficiency Evaluation

Efficiency is a critical aspect of a player's performance. The **Efficiency** section provides key information on whether the player is able to achieve high performance while efficiently using resources. A player who can excel with minimal resources showcases adaptability and skill. This metric goes beyond the traditional performance indicators and provides a more holistic view of a player's capabilities.

#### Champion Pool and Playstyle Analysis

The **Champion Pool** subsection is dedicated to exploring the champions a player is proficient in. It offers insights into each champion's KDA, win rate, and more. The section also features a unique similarity graph, visually representing the relationship between the champions the player has used. This graph aids in identifying the player's playstyle, revealing patterns and potential preferences. The similarity graph is built on a content-based recommender system, and our goal is to continually enhance and refine this feature to provide even more accurate insights.

The Player Statistics section of ProLeagueVizz empowers you to uncover hidden patterns, gain valuable insights, and better understand the performance of professional League of Legends players. It's not just about raw data; it's about deriving meaningful and actionable information that enhances your appreciation of the game.

### Team Statistics (Work in Progress)

The **Team Statistics** section of ProLeagueVizz is an upcoming feature that aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of professional League of Legends teams. Although this section is currently under development, our vision is to offer a wealth of information about various pro teams, including player statistics, team synergy, and playstyle tendencies.

#### Team Overview

Gain insights into different professional teams, their key players, and their achievements. Dive into team-specific details and learn about their performance in various tournaments and events.

#### Player Stats and Synergy

Explore detailed statistics for individual players within a team and examine how they contribute to the team's overall performance. Understand the synergy between players based on their champion pools and performance metrics.

#### Playstyle Tendencies

Discover each team's unique playstyle tendencies, such as their approach to objectives like the first drake and Baron, as well as their preferred areas of action on the map. While certain data might not be readily available for free, our goal is to leverage fight tendencies of each player in soloQ to generate insightful information regarding team tendencies.

### Team Comparison (Work in Progress)

The **Team Comparison** section is a future addition to ProLeagueVizz that will enable users to compare different professional League of Legends teams. This powerful feature will allow you to gain a deeper understanding of how teams stack up against each other.

#### Compare Teams and Players

Effortlessly compare the statistics, player performance, and playstyle tendencies of two different teams. Identify strengths, weaknesses, and areas of differentiation that set each team apart.

#### Analyze Playstyles

Understand the nuances of each team's playstyle, including their strategic preferences, objective priorities, and map control. By comparing playstyles, you can gain insights into the strategic depth and decision-making of the teams.

As we continue to develop ProLeagueVizz, the Team Statistics and Team Comparison sections will add new layers of insight and analysis to your understanding of professional League of Legends. Stay tuned for updates as we work to bring these features to life.
